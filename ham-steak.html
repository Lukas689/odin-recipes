        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spiral hams are delicious, but they yield so much meat. When you're craving
            ham, but don't want to fuss with an entire one, ham steaks are the way to go!
            This is also gread for a holiday celebration with only a handful of people. 
            Instead of roasting and glazing a whole ham, just make everyone their own 
            perfectly cooked, savory-sweet steak.
