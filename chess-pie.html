        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chess Pie is very similar to the classic Buttermilk Pie. It's a simple custard pie
            mostly made from eggs, sugar and butter (what's not to love!) and typically includes 
            a bit cornmeal for a ncie subtle texture. It's wonderful on its own, with a dusting 
            of powdered sugar, or served with fresh fruit.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 425°. Roll out pie crust and place in a 9" round pie dish. Trim 
                and crimp edges and poke bottom of crust all over with a fork. Place in freezer 
                to chill for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place parchment paper inside pie crust and fill with pie weights or dried beans. 
                Bake until golden about 15 minutes, then carefully remove parchment and pie 
                weights and bake 10 minutes more. Let cool while making pie filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce oven temperature to 325°. In a large bowl whisk eggs and sugar together. 
                Add melted butter, milk, vinegar, and vanilla and whisk until incorporated. Add 
                cornmeal, flour and salt and whisk until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour filling into pie crust and bake until just set in the middle, 50 minutes. Let 
                cool at room temperature, then place in refrigerator until ready to server, at least 4 hours.
